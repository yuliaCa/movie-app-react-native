# movie-app-react-native

Index screen, which is Movies screen works. 
Pulling popular movies, now playing, top rated and upcoming.

Details for each movie are pulled up with a new API call, showed on a separate screen.

Search screen - form and functions are setup. However, not tested, the list of results is not rendered.

Unfortunately, did not get to the TV Shows screen at all. Left the commented out code, to show what I would start with.
